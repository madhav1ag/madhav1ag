### Hi, 
I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/idcom/" target="_blank">IDCOM</a>
in the <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">School of Engineering</a>, 
<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a>. I am a member of <a href="https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/vision/index.html" target="_blank">Vision Group</a> and <a href="https://vios.science/" target="_blank">VIOS</a>, working under the supervision
of <a href="https://smcdonagh.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Steven McDonagh</a> and 
<a href="https://laurasevilla.me/" target="_blank">Dr. Laura Sevilla</a>. 
My interest lies in Multimodal Learning, Spatial-Temporal Understanding in Foundation Models, and Generative AI.

Before moving to the UK, I spent a wonderful year in Germany working on building lip-syncing and synthetic media generation models. 
I also spent three months at <a href="https://niessnerlab.org/" target="_blank">Visual Computing & Artificial Intelligence</a> group at <a href="https://www.tum.de" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich</a>
with <a href="https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html"
target="_blank">Prof. Matthias Nie√üner</a>.

I completed MS by Research at <a href="http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank">CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. C.V. Jawahar</a> and <a href="https://vinaypn.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri</a>.  My graduate research focused on Lip-Sync, Talking Head Generation, and Face Reenactment, along with their optimization for real-world problems. 
Additionally, I worked on the task of Table Detection in Document Images with high accuracy under the supervision of Prof. C.V. Jawahar and Dr. Ajoy Mondal. 
Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist and a team lead with several companies, broadly in the domains of Facial Recognition, Video Surveillance using AI, and Document Image Processing.

### Hi, 
I am an MS by Research student at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). I'm guided by [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html) and co-guided by [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/). My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning. My graduate research focuses on Lip-Sync and Deep Fakes generation along with their optimization for real world problems. Earlier, I worked on the task of Table Detection in Document Images with high accuracy under the guidance of Prof. C.V. Jawahar and Dr. Ajoy Mondal. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist with couple of start-ups working broadly in the domain of Facial Recognition, Video Survillence using AI and Document Image Processing.

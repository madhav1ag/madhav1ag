### Hi, 
I am an MS by Research student at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/). I'm guided by [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html) and co-guided by [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. My graduate research focuses on Lip-Sync, Deep Fakes and Talking Head Generation along with their optimization for real-world problems. I also have worked on the task of Table Detection in Document Images with high accuracy under the guidance of Prof. C.V. Jawahar and Dr. Ajoy Mondal. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist with couple of start-ups, working broadly in the domain of Facial Recognition, Video surveillance using AI, and Document Image Processing.
